## Description
This project is a part of the Becode.org AI Bootcamp programme. The goal is to produce a supervised classifier for anomalous sound detection in industrial machines for a fictional company Acme Corporation. Data samples of normal and abnormal sounds of valves, pumps, fans and sliders are provided.

## Objectives

- Be able to work and process data from audio format
- Find insights from data, build hypothesis and define conclusions
- Build machine learning models for predictive classification and/or regression
- Select the right performance metrics for your model
- Evaluate the distribution of data points and evaluate its influence in the model
- Be able to identify underfitting or overfitting that might exist on the model
- Tuning parameters of the model for better performance
- Select the model with better performance and following your customer's requirements
- Define the strengths and limitations of the model

### Strengths

- The model works for all the types of machines with acceptable accuracy.
- The model provides intial insights to detect abnormalities.

### Limitations

- Undersampled examples of abnormal sounds
- Overfitting in the current model 

### Further Developments

- Finetuning the model per machine
- Trying different machine learning techniques

## Repo Architecture

- *(1) README.md* Project documentation
- *(2) Download folders with audio data.ipynb* A Jupyter Notebook file with code to download data samples from provided resource
- *(3) Create a dataframe with files.ipynb* A Jupyter Notebook file with code to create a dataframe and .csv file with filenames
- *(4) anomaly_files.csv* .csv file with filenames of provided samples
- *(5) Extract feature 6dB machine.ipynb* A Jupyter Notebook file with code to extract features and targets for 6dB samples of all machines 
- *(6) ASD_model.ipynb* A Jupyter Notebook file with code to make a prediction ML model
- *(7) ASD_model.pkl* A pickelised ML model to easily deploy

## Installation

 *git clone* the repo 


## Usage

To use this model run (2) and (3) to collect the data samples and extract the features by running file (5). Next run (6) or use (7) to run a prediction.

## Timeline

The project took 4 working days to write a code and was presented on the 5th day.
